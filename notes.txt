- form validation: create and edit

Does it make sense to have two models and two controllers 
for 2 different schemas coming from the same database?

QUESTIONS

MongoDB
mongoDB setup ok?
create an additional schema for users and use JWT?
Okta or Auth0?

Logic
How could I set up recurring elements.
Monthly, weekly, yearly.

CSS 
Bootstrap, MUI or what?

Deployment?

Store-App
For my other app I have a user that saves his id in sessionStorage.
When a user is not logged in where should I store the cart?


different structure, model vs (budget, invoice)



// @desc    Get goals
// @route   GET /api/goals
// @access  Private


For now container for Home but will transition to grid once there are more components
